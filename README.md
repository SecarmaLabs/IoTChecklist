# IoTChecklist
Baseline IoT security checklist. Consider security as early in development as possible and reap the rewards.

There is a blog post explaining the origins of this along with some fundamentals available here:

# What is this checklist?

The "checklist" is designed to aid you in enumerating the attack surface of your device, then giving you the six root causes as a discussion piece. If you have previously never engaged with security before this is a starting point. The two blank spreadsheets have been provided to track your progress. To follow the process first clone down this repository, and then interact with the two spreadsheets as summarised below:

1) Blank-Device_Decomposition_Matrix.xlsx - Logically break your device down to list individual components which may carry either a technical or a privacy/legal risk. The first step to securing your device is to find the items which may be attacked. Armed with this list you must then either research or discuss with a security expert HOW each item may be attacked. Try to determine the potential impact of a compromise. Then seek advice to see how likely a compromise would be. Add in additional columns as required to capture your discussions.
2) Blank-IoT_CheckList.xlsx - This contains two sheets. The first is the six security fundamentals. If you have not engages these points before then you should do so as soon as possible. The second sheet has special considerations for a number of inter device networking/communications systems including: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GSM, Infrared, LoRaWAN. There are entire books and courses devoted to securing each of those so networking choices are a big topic.
